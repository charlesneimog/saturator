30/07/16 2:13 PM v0.3.5
	Prepared for deken distribution

04/16/15 12:12 PM v0.3.4
	Added yosemite build, changed license to Apache 2.0

11/12/09 21:11 v0.3.3
	Added a winxp build

7/2/08 16:34 PM paulo
	Made expensive algorithm more efficient.

v0.3.2

7/2/08 15:44 PM paulo
	put TD algorithms in saturator_td.c

7/2/08 15:14 PM paulo
	Fixed several TD bugs. Proper transformations are:
	Pow: thresh + (1-thresh)[(factor-thresh)/(1-thresh) ] ^ param
	Cos: thresh + (1-thresh) * [0.5 + 0.5 * cos((factor-thresh)pi/(1-thresh) - pi)]


v0.3.1

7/2/08 12:18 PM paulo
	Fixed autogain bug on expensive TD algorithm.
	Fixed help for expensive TD.

7/2/08 4:28 AM paulo
	Added new time-dependent implementation.
	Now threshold varies. Is more expensive and not the default.
	Use cheap method to enable and disable.
	Added saturator_tresh~ object which  outputs current
	thresh on second outlet. Only relevant for expensive algorithm.

v0.3.0

7/2/08 12:46 AM paulo
	Cleaned code to use float more.

7/2/08 12:36 AM paulo
	Added any N-Polynomial.
	Cleaned code to use derived form only.
	Arbitrarily limited to 736.

7/2/08 12:05 AM paulo
	Added Order 4 and 5, quartic function.

7/1/08 11:40 PM paulo
	Added Order 4, quartic function.

v0.2.2

7/1/08 7:20 PM paulo
	Made it manually set factor when duration = 0. Before it was behaving as if duration = 1 when it was actually 0.
	Fixed help-saturator. Before time dependent controls where affecting transfer function display.
7/1/08 6:38 PM paulo
	fixed comment. rms/sec is supposed to be rms/ms


v0.2.1

7/1/08 1:16 PM paulo
	commented data structure.
	fixed bug when thresh=1 (was not iterating ins and outs).
	added an autogain method to enable/disable autogain. (default is enabled).
	changed makefile to copy build to DESTINATION in darwin.

v0.2.0

6/30/08 9:52 PM paulo
	finished help-saturator~.pd and added to build install.

6/30/08 4:16 PM paulo
	added help-saturator~.pd
	TODO: requires that the build installs it in the right place.

6/30/08 4:14 PM paulo
	separated vu into separate object: saturator_vu~.
	now requires that saturator be loaded to load the classes
		of saturator~ and saturator_vu~
	fixed some bugs in vu.

v0.1.3

4/21/08 1:02 PM paulo
	Now with VU attenuation on second outlet. 0 means no attenuation

v0.1.2

4/21/08 11:47 AM paulo
	fixed init bug. was not setting threshold on init

4/20/08 3:11 PM paulo
	Now has different type of attack and release. can be:
		linear
		pow, raised by passed value
		cos: cos(x*pi-pi)/2 + .5

v0.1.1.1

4/20/08 1:19 PM paulo
	fixed key get time bug. Cause the tangents to not much up.

v0.1.1

3/23/08 12:11 PM paulo
	*** empty log message ***

v0.1.0

3/23/08 13:04 PM paulo
